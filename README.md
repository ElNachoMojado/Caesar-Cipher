# Ceasar-Cipher
My first project in ruby from the TOP syllabus. Caesar Cipher is an encryption technique in which each letter is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. That is to say that a shift of five would replace letter E for A, and so on. It won't be necessary any special knowledge of the language and will only require basic knowledge of conditionals.
